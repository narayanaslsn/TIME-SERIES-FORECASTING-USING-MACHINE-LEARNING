# TIME-SERIES-FORECASTING-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING

This Project contains jupyter Notebook files of  4 Algorithms : Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression , Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).

All the Algorithms are Implemented on three Datasets : Ahmedabad.csv, MounaLoa.csv and INFY.NS.csv files which are the datsets of Petrol Prices, Weather and Stock Price repectively.

The Results are calculated on Mainly RMSE(Root Mean Square Error),R2_squared Error, Correlation to compare the analaysis between the algorithms.

The Results of the Prediction vs Actual was also plotted for all the algorithms respectively.
